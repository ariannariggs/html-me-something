    <p>There's a subtle pattern that dictates a large amout of how you emotionally respond to art. Namely, shapes. 
        There are generally 7 accepted elements of art. (not the principles of art which usually describes how elements are arranged or organized in the art.)
        here I'll be talking about one of the 7, shape.  </p>
        <h2>Circles</h2>
            <p>It may seem a little reductionist to talk about all of art in terms of shape, but humor me. A circle is often seen as soft, unassuming, it's rounded edges are gentle and kind. 
                This is why the most recognizable friendly, wholesome character in animation is drawn in nearly all circles. You also find circles in characters like Winnie-the-pooh and Totoro.

            </p>
        <h2>Squares</h2>
            <p>Squares by contrast are seen as solid and stable, as well as strong and boring (or slow to change). Calling someone a "square" is usually a term for describing someone as boring.
                Continuing with the examples of animated characters (where artists can create individuals any shape they choose) The strong, dependable Ralph from wreck-it-ralph and the stuborn, "boring" old man from UP and the "responsible adult" Professor in the Powerpuff Girls are all square based characters .

                </figure> 
            </p>
        <h2>Triangles</h2>
            <p>Triangles can inspire feelings of danger and sharpness. You see triangles in traditional devil horns, in warning or caution signs and in animated villians like maleficent, The Joker, and Jafar.
                These shapes are freuently used as antagonists to play against the soft rounds circle of the protagonists. </p>

        <h2>Extrapolation</h2>
            <p>While the examples listed apply to animation, the general emotions invoked can apply in a far broader context. In cinema shapes will subtle appear in framing from the body, or deliberate curves vs. spikes in camera movement/set design/costume design or frames. These motifs of gentle curves in contrast to sharp appear in everything from set design in plays to videogame boss, battles. 
                Knowing the basics of the feeling these shapes inspire will help you become more critical of the art you create. (As all the elements of art should!) </p>
